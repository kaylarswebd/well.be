            <h3></h3>
            <p>Taking care of your physical health is closely linked to your mental well-being. By adopting healthy lifestyle habits, you can boost your mood, reduce stress, and improve your overall mental health. Here are key areas to focus on:</p>

            <h3>Nourish Your Body</h3>
            <p>Eating a balanced and nutritious diet is essential for both your physical and mental health. Incorporate foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive consumption of processed foods, sugary snacks, and caffeine, as they can negatively impact your mood and energy levels.</p>

            <h3>Stay Active</h3>
            <p>Regular physical exercise has profound benefits for your mental health. Engaging in activities like walking, running, dancing, or yoga releases endorphins, the "feel-good" hormones that elevate your mood and reduce anxiety. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week, and find activities that you enjoy to make it a sustainable habit.</p>

Minimize exposure to screens before bedtime, engage in relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, and ensure your sleep environment is comfortable and free from distractions.</p>

            <h1></h1>
            <h3>Seek Professional Help When Needed</h3>
